  Information such as keyboard interactions

While the service is running there are some keyboard shortcuts to see additional information. These can be used from a keyboard plugged into the Pi or via VNC. VNC is available via IP or the name you set earlier (ex: `mylittlepi` is available via `mylittlepi.local`).

- __d__: Displays the daily weather screen
- __h__: Displays the hourly weather screen
- __i__: Displays an info screen which contains some additional info information
- __q__: Quits the program

> More information on VNC is available on from the Raspberry Pi Foundation at https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/
