1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of the page.
2. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
3. Follow the rest of the [Quick start](../quick-start) process to make, preview, and propose your changes.
