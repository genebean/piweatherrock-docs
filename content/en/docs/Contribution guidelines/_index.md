  How to contribute to the docs
---

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate this website, the
[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure,
and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site.
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides templates,
a standard directory structure in which to organize content, and a website generation
engine. Pages can be written in Markdown or HTML (or both if you want), and Hugo
will convert them into a website like this one.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, must come via a GitHub
pull requests. Consult GitHub's [Proposing changes to your work with pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
docs for more information.
