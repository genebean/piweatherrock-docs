First and foremost, thank you for even considering contributing! I've broken this section down into sub-sections that focus on particular aspects of the project. Feel free to reach on on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PiWeatherRock/community) if you run into any issues or don't find what you are looking for.

## GitHub

Don't let the idea of using GitHub scare you off - it's likely easier than you think to get started submitting things on it. This project and all of the documentation rely on it so all submissions, including submissions by project members, must come via a GitHub
pull requests. Have a look at their [Proposing changes to your work with pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
docs for information on how this works or, as mentioned before, reach out on Gitter.
