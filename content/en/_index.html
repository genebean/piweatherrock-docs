On March 30, 2020 an announcement was posted to the <a href="https://blog.darksky.net">Dark Sky Blog</a> stating that they have
been acquired by Apple. The announcement went on to say that they are no longer accepting new requests for API access and that they
will be shutting the API down at the end of 2021.

This unfortunate bit of news isn't the end of this project... I've been here before. This just means that I will have to do a third
API migration. Work related to this, and suggestions on what API to use, are being tracked in
<a href="https://github.com/genebean/PiWeatherRock/issues/48">issue 48</a> of the project's GitHub repo.

PiWeatherRock displays local weather from Dark Sky on (almost) any screen you connect to a Raspberry Pi.

{{< blocks/section color="white" >}}
PiWeatherRock has three screens that it cycles through to show you a daily forecast, a hourly forecast, and an information screen.
The weather show is from Dark Sky and is hyper-local which makes it much more accurate than many other sources. Data is refereshed
every five minutes so that you'll always have up-to-date information before heading outside.
